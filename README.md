Social-Beast
============

Social Beast aims to give users of blogging applications such as Wordpress, Joomla, etc., the ability to publish their content to various social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr using powerful features from their API's that I don't see in use very often. Target features can be found in the wiki.
